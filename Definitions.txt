Asynchronous Apex:
-----------------
An asynchronous process is a process or function that executes a task "in the background" without the user having to wait for the task to finish.
	@future - async, run on seperate thread
		- static void
		- allow primitive types
	Batch apex - large amount of record to process
	Queueable - queue processess
	schedule - process at specific time
				 
security:
---------
sharing(with sharing we are going security settings(user context))(with-out we are going without going security setting)
		owd 
		profiles 
		roles
		manual 
		hierarchhy
apex integration services:
--------------------------
	An Apex callout enables you to tightly integrate your Apex code with an external service. The callout makes a call to an external web service or sends an HTTP request from Apex code, and then receives the response.
Apex callouts come in two flavors.

Web service callouts to SOAP web services use XML, and typically require a WSDL document for code generation.
HTTP callouts to services typically use REST with JSON.
These two types of callouts are similar in terms of sending a request to a service and receiving a response. But while WSDL-based callouts apply to SOAP Web services, HTTP callouts can be used with any HTTP service, either SOAP or REST.
